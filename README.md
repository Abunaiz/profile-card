## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to "fix" a leaking background from a image with border-radius: 50% and border together.
I wrapped the image with a div an put the border and the background of the div with the same color. It is still leaking but it do not get noticed because the leaking background has the same color than the border.

### Continued development

I need to learn about background positioning.

### Useful resources

- [Notion] I used some notes about css from my notion account.
